# React Notes

## Wes Bos Advanced React

I'm taking notes on https://github.dev/patrickjohnstevens/docublog/tree/main/PJSDocBlog so I'm coding while I'm taking notes. Plus, I am already using my VSCode Desktop App for the course I'm watching.

The primary tech stack for this project/course is React(UI Templates)/Next.js(framework)/Apollo Client(GraphQL)/Styled Components(Modular CSS) for the frontend and Keystone.js(CMS)/node.js(Backend Server Runtime Env)/MongoDB(Database) for the backend.

Keeping the Markdown features on Docusaurous link handy: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#quotes

> ### Idea
>
> I wonder how easy it would be for me to not use Keystone.js and instead us Headless Wordpress?
> Why do this? Simple, I will be able to learn more about Headless Wordpress and be able to give a talk about it at the Omaha Wordpress meetup.

<h3>Next.js rendering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Server</li>
  <li>Client</li>
  <li>Static - Prerendering. Docusaurous does a lot of this kind of thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This is HTML and it should render like the rest of the MDX/MD text because
  that gets converted to HTML anyways.
