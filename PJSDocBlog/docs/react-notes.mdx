# React Notes

## Wes Bos Advanced React

I'm taking notes on https://github.dev/patrickjohnstevens/docublog/tree/main/PJSDocBlog so I'm coding while I'm taking notes. Plus, I am already using my VSCode Desktop App for the course I'm watching.

The primary tech stack for this project/course is React(UI Templates)/Next.js(framework)/Apollo Client(GraphQL)/Styled Components(Modular CSS) for the frontend and Keystone.js(CMS)/node.js(Backend Server Runtime Env)/MongoDB(Database) for the backend.

Keeping the Markdown features on Docusaurous link handy: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#quotes

> I wonder how easy it would be for me to not use Keystone.js and instead us Headless Wordpress?
