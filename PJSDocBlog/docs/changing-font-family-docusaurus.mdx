# Change The Font-Family in Docusaurus

## Why?

I decided to change the fonts for two main reasons:

1. I wanted to make my site seem a little different than the default Docusaurus font
2. I wanted to learn how to change the font-family in Docusaurus

The objective of this doc is to change the font-family in Docusaurus from the default Docusaurus fonts to the [Hubot Sans & Mona Sans fonts](https://github.com/mona-sans).

## The 5 Steps to Change the Font-Family in Docusaurus

1. Download the Hubot Sans & Mona Sans fonts
2. Create a new folder in the `static` folder called `fonts` and move the non-zipped fonts saved locally into the `fonts` folder
3. Update the CSS to use the new fonts
4. Add Head tags to preload the fonts
5. Test the site and make sure the fonts are working

### 1. Download Fonts

Download the fonts here: [Hubot Sans & Mona Sans fonts](https://github.com/mona-sans)

### 2. Setup Folder and Files

Look at the [GitHub code from this site](https://github.com/patrickjohnstevens/docublog/tree/main/PJSDocBlog/static/fonts) for an example of what the folder and file structure should look like

Here is a screenshot from my VS Code to give you a different visual:

### 3. Update CSS

https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets#in-markdown

Here is a link to the [GitHub code](https://github.com/patrickjohnstevens/docublog/blob/main/PJSDocBlog/src/css/custom.css)

```css @font-face
@font-face {
  font-family: "Hubot Sans";
  src: url("/static/fonts/Hubot-Sans.woff2") format("woff2 supports variations"),
    url("/static/fonts/Hubot-Sans.woff2") format("woff2-variations");
  font-weight: 200 900;
  font-stretch: 75% 125%;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Mona Sans";
  src: url("/static/fonts/Mona-Sans.woff2") format("woff2 supports variations"),
    url("/static/fonts/Mona-Sans.woff2") format("woff2-variations");
  font-weight: 200 900;
  font-stretch: 75% 125%;
}

html {
  font-family: "Mona Sans";
}

h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  font-family: "Hubot Sans";
}
```

### 4. Add headTags

There was a little more tricky than what I was used to when changing fonts in WordPress. I had to look at some real world examples and do a few experiments to get the fonts to work. I started with just one font and then added the second font once I got the first one working.

Here is a link to the [GitHub code](https://github.com/patrickjohnstevens/docublog/blob/main/PJSDocBlog/docusaurus.config.js)

#### Add headTags to docusaurus.config.js

```js

const config = {
  title: "Patrick John Stevens",
  tagline: "Here To Serve",
  url: "https://docs.patrickjohnstevens.com",
  baseUrl: "/",
  onBrokenLinks: "throw",
  onBrokenMarkdownLinks: "warn",
  favicon: "img/Patrick-John-Stevens_logo_lightbulb.svg",
  organizationName: "Patrick John Stevens",
  projectName: "docublog",

  headTags: [
    {
      tagName: "link",
      attributes: {
        rel: "preload",
        href: "static/fonts/Hubot-Sans.woff2",
        as: "font",
        type: "font/woff2",
        crossorigin: "anonymous",
      },
    },
    {
      tagName: "link",
      attributes: {
        rel: "preload",
        href: "static/fonts/Mono-Sans.woff2",
        as: "font",
        type: "font/woff2",
        crossorigin: "anonymous",
      },
    },
  ],
```

### 5. Manual Testing

I used the Chrome Dev Tools to check out the fonts as well as the CSS Peeper browser extension.
