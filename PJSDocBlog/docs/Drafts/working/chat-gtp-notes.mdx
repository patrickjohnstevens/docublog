## What is ChatGPT

ChatGPT AI Chatbot is best utilized asking questions in a conversational manner. The more conversational you are the better the results.

I have found you can be very creative with the questions you ask and the results you get. Some of the low hanging fruit is asking questions about the random daily questions you have, weather, sports, and other general topics.

- Ask questions that are short and to the point. They are also very specific and provide context
- Try asking things that you'd typically seek in Google or Stack Overflow when you are stuck on a problem
- Don't treat the anser as gospel. It's a good starting point but you should always verify the answer with other sources.
