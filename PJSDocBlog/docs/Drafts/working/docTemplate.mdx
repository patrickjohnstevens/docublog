## Overview

This is a summary of the document. It should be a short paragraph that describes the document and its purpose. Many times this is broken down into a few bullet points / elements.

- Problem. Note the key topic or problem of your document.
- Method. State your main approach to solving the problem.
- Results. Provide one or two important results.
- Conclusion. Note your main conclusion.

If the document isn't finished, the emphasis on this section is placed on the problem and the method. The results and conclusion are left out.

It could use an admonition like this:

### What You Will Learn / Readable Table of Contents

```

This is a simple code box. This is a differnt way make certain parts stand out and also add code blocks.

- Problem. Note the key topic or problem of your document.
- Method. State your main approach to solving the problem.

## Write Excellent docs

Give writing documentation and blogs the same care and consideration as we do to the features we ship.

### Case Driven Documentation / Goal Driven Documentation

The main idea is to make the cases or goals of your user / reader the focus point of your documentation instead of just describing interface elements on the nav and page.

Instead of writing how to write a function... you would instead write how to write a function that does X or solves Y problem.

### Write for the user

Write documentation and blogs that help people achieve their goals. Remember, we are writing docs and blogs for people, not for machines.

Truthfully, people don't mind reading and may even be thankful for the documentation as long as it's actually helpful to them.

To conclude, the goal of a technical docs and blogs is not only to be accurate and consistent but also honest, helpful and human.

Honest by communicating the pros and cons of a solution to build trust.

Helpful by helping users to succeed as theirs is ultimately our success.

Human because we want to feel familiar and approachable.
