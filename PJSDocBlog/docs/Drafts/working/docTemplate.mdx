**How ChatGPT Can Make You A Better Web Developer**

---

## Overview

ChatGPT AI Chatbot is best utilized asking questions in a conversational manner. The more conversational you are the better the results.

I have found you can be very creative with the questions you ask and the results you get. Some of the low hanging fruit is asking questions about the random daily questions you have, weather, sports, and other general topics.

- Ask questions that are short and to the point. They are also very specific and provide context
- Try asking things that you'd typically seek in Google or Stack Overflow when you are stuck on a problem
- Don't treat the anser as gospel. It's a good starting point but you should always verify the answer with other sources.

### What You Will Learn / Readable Table of Contents

```

This is a simple code box. This is a differnt way make certain parts stand out and also add code blocks.

- Problem. Note the key topic or problem of your document.
- Method. State your main approach to solving the problem.
- Results. Provide one or two important results.
- Conclusion. Note your main conclusion.

## Write Excellent docs

Give writing documentation and blogs the same care and consideration as we do to the features we ship.

### Case Driven Documentation / Goal Driven Documentation

The main idea is to make the cases or goals of your user / reader the focus point of your documentation instead of just describing interface elements on the nav and page.

Instead of writing how to write a function... you would instead write how to write a function that does X or solves Y problem.

### Write for the user

Write documentation and blogs that help people achieve their goals. Remember, we are writing docs and blogs for people, not for machines.

Truthfully, people don't mind reading and may even be thankful for the documentation as long as it's actually helpful to them.

To conclude, the goal of a technical docs and blogs is not only to be accurate and consistent but also honest, helpful and human.

Honest by communicating the pros and cons of a solution to build trust.

Helpful by helping users to succeed as theirs is ultimately our success.

Human because we want to feel familiar and approachable.
