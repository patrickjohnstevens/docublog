## Overview

- Find Your Calling
  - Don't waste time building a business you hate
  - Focus on your purpose by completing your Ikigai
  - Ikigai = your reason for being
  - The thing that gets you up in the morning
- Mentors Are Everything
  - You are the product of the 5 people you are surrounded by.
  - Reach out to people you respect (steal this template):
- Business is About Systems
  - For Marketing Systems learn to write with @dickiebush
  - For Community Systems learn from @gregisenberg
  - For Finance Systems learn Excel from @blakeaburge
  - For Copywriting Systems go with @thejustinwelsh
  - For Software Systems get started with @jspeiser
- Publish Content Daily
  - Choose 2 platforms. I recommend LinkedIn and Twitter.
  - Start writing around your calling and people will come.
  - Consistency is key.
- Drive People to Your Email List
  - Email is the best way to build a relationship with your audience.
  - Use a tool like @convertkit to build your list.
  - Use @mailchimp to send emails.
  - Use @getdrip to automate your emails.
  - Put a link in your Twitter bio and LinkedIn Featured Section.
- Survey Your Community
  - Ask people what they want to see from you.
- Find something in your calling and mix it with a monetization strategy:
  - Paid Newsletter
  - Membership
  - Consulting
  - Course
  - SaaS
- Build a product people will pay you for
  - Start with a quick and simple mock up
  - Build it with a no-code or low tool initially to get it in paying customers hands

## Write Excellent docs

Give writing documentation and blogs the same care and consideration as we do to the features we ship.

### Case Driven Documentation / Goal Driven Documentation

The main idea is to make the cases or goals of your user / reader the focus point of your documentation instead of just describing interface elements on the nav and page.

Instead of writing how to write a function... you would instead write how to write a function that does X or solves Y problem.

### Write for the user

Write documentation and blogs that help people achieve their goals. Remember, we are writing docs and blogs for people, not for machines.

Truthfully, people don't mind reading and may even be thankful for the documentation as long as it's actually helpful to them.

To conclude, the goal of a technical docs and blogs is not only to be accurate and consistent but also honest, helpful and human.

Honest by communicating the pros and cons of a solution to build trust.

Helpful by helping users to succeed as theirs is ultimately our success.

Human because we want to feel familiar and approachable.
