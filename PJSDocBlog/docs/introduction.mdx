# Introduction

What's up wonderful people! Welcome to my public learning and creating hub!

My name is Patrick John Stevens. I started my web developent journey near the end of 2015. The rest of the story is still being written. Ha!

This site is utlized as my personal public knowledge hub for my learning notes, summariezed documentation, personal portfolio, resource links and recommendations, and published content.

This website was inspired by the ideas of Learn In Public made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank">@swyx</a> and many of the awesome developers and teachers across the world who learn, build, teach, and publish content for others to learn and grow from.

## Statement of Purpose

The primary purpose of this website is to help myself and other developers to **learn**, **create** and **teach** content to assist in the learning process while adding value and inspiring others to do the same.

You can learn more about the inital and primary purpose of this site and learning, creating, and teaching in public [here](/docs/category/about).

## Learn In Public

“You share what you learn, as you learn it. You Open Source your knowledge. You build a public record of your interests and progress, and along the way, you attract a community of mentors, peers, and supporters. They will help you learn faster than you ever could on your own. Your network could be vast, consisting of experts in every field, unconstrained by your org chart.” - @swyx

## Create In Public

Learning in needs to be synonymous with creating in public. Creating valuable things based on what you are learning is a wonderfuly funtastic way to grow in life while adding value and serving others. On this adventure it is very important to balance our learning and consumption with creating and giving. "This is way" as Mando would say.

## Teach In Public

We won't truly understand what we learn until we can teach it to someone else. Einstein said, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Learning gives you the knowledge and creating gives you the experience but it's teaching gives you the understanding and wisdom.
