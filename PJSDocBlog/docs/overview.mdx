# Knowledge Base Overview

This is built using Docusourus. This site contains the public docs, portfolio, links, and published content for myself, Patrick John Stevens.

### Statement of Purpose

The primary purpose of this website is to help myself and other developers to **learn**, **build** and **publish\*** teachable content to assist in the learning process while adding value and inspiring others to do the same.

### The Learn-Build-Publish Principles

This website was inspired by the ideas of Learn In Public made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank">@swyx</a> and many of the awesome developers and teachers across the world who learn, build, teach, and publish content for others to learn and grow from.

You can learn more about myself and the details about this site in [the first article](http://localhost:3000/docs/articles/about-this-site-and-about-me) I posted here.
