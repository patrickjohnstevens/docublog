# Knowledge Hub Overview

What's up wonderful people! Welcome to my public learning and creating hub!

My name is Patrick John Stevens. I started my web developent journey near the end of 2015. The rest of the story is still being written. Ha!

This site is utlized as my personal public knowledge hub for my learning notes, summariezed documentation, personal portfolio, resource links and recommendations, and published content

### Statement of Purpose

The primary purpose of this website is to help myself and other developers to **learn**, **create** and **teach** content to assist in the learning process while adding value and inspiring others to do the same.

### The Learn-Create-Publish Principles

This website was inspired by the ideas of Learn In Public made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank">@swyx</a> and many of the awesome developers and teachers across the world who learn, build, teach, and publish content for others to learn and grow from.

You can learn more about myself and the details about this site in [the first article](\docs\about\about-this-site.mdx) I posted here.
