# Courses and Tutorials Tips

## Initial Viewing Tips

On your initial viewing of a course or tutorial Do's and Do Not's:

**DOs** & **DON'Ts**

- Focus as if you were in person
- Pay attention with your eyes and your ears
- Watch the lesson and take notes on key idea, the process, the steps, the thought process, and things that will help you look up the solution to each step along the way
- Don't focus on the specific code to copy in your notes on the initial viewing
- Don't constantly pause the video or stop reading the lesson to type along
- During the lesson, try to not code along the first time you watch it
- After the lesson, try to apply the example or process yourself in VS Code or in an online IDE like https://replit.com, https://github.dev, etc...
- When the video is over, try out what you've watched. If needed, utilize the individual lessons as a reference and return to the ones that you need to understand in more depth now that you have a little better idea of the big picture
- Watch the first round at 1.5-2x speed with subtitles for increased concentration and cues from the subtitles
