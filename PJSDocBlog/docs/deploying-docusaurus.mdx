# Deploying Docusaurus

## What was the plan?

Well... the closest thing to a plan I got was adding task/issue to my Public Roadmap after I started to make progress on the task... Great timing! Ha!

## Vercel vs. Netlify

There were a lot of options but these are the two I wanted to try the most. I initially tried Netlify but I had an issue... probably a user issue but I didn't want to debug... ha! So I did what the next logical thing to do was... I tried Vercel! The great news is that it worked the first time! So I have to say Vercel is WAY better. Ha!

## What did I learn?

In other news, I learned a few things. When I started setting up my personal domain, which was purchased through NameCheap a long time ago, I started having issues getting my personal domain <https://www.patrickjohnstevens.com/> to work. I removed a redirect in NameCheap which I learned was not a think I should have done. I was having issues because of that and I ended up deleting my Vercel build and giving another go after I updated my domain within the Docusaurus config file (I think it was a non breaking change). I also updated the A record and CNAME record along with having the redirect added back and this time it worked. My website was officially live on my personal domain name. Next, I wanted to add a subdomain. I went with <https://hub.patrickjohnstevens.com/> for now. They all work technically.

## Next steps?

I want to see the auto build and redeploy magic that Vercel has with adding this new doc. I'm going to bed as it's past my bedtime and I need to sleep. Thank you, Jesus!
