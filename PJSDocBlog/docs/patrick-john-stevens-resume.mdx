**Judge - UC Berkeley's Scaling Up Big Ideas** | _November 2014 - December 2014_

#### Who are Big Ideas judges?

Judges are professionals from a variety of fields with one thing in common: a passion for innovative ideas. To ensure we provide teams with the best feedback possible and help them to think deeply about their topic and the field, it falls into, we look for judges who have a minimum of 5 years of professional experience and at least ONE of the following:

- Professional skills critical to supporting early-stage startups (e.g. Business plan development,
  Scalability and design thinking, Financial Modeling, IP Strategy, Market Research,
  Organizational design, Branding/consumer engagement)
- Expertise in an industry/field that is directly related to one of the 9 Big Ideas Contest categories (e.g. ICT, International Development, CleanTech, Social Justice, Big Data, etc).

#### What do Big Ideas Judges do?

Judges help the Big Ideas team determine who will advance to the final round of the contest and who will be selected to receive awards. Judges review student proposals, score them and provide detailed feedback on how the student or team could improve upon their idea or proposal. This feedback is extremely valuable to students, who receive it anonymously and rely heavily on it to improve their idea!
