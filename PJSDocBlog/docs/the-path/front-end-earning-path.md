# Frontend Development Overview

I thought it would be a good idea to publish and consistently update my learning journey. The idea here is to provide thoughts and suggestions around the content and resources I am utilizing on this journey.

## Frontend Web Dev Roadmap and Resources

Roadmap: <https://roadmap.sh/frontend>

## JavaScript

Roadmap: <https://roadmap.sh/javascript>

## TypeScript

Roadmap: <https://roadmap.sh/typescript> (Not published yet)

## React/Next/Remix/Solid/QwikCity

Roadmap: <https://roadmap.sh/react>

## SvelteKit

Roadmap:

## Node.js

Roadmap - <https://roadmap.sh/nodejs>

## Go

Roadmap: <https://roadmap.sh/golang>

During this process, I came across some learning path documentation that lead me to <https://roadmap.sh>. Roadmap.sh is a community effort to create roadmaps, guides and other educational content to help guide the developers in picking up the path and guide their learnings.
