# About

This is built using Docusourus. This site includes my public docs, portfolio, and published content.

### About Me

**My name is Patrick John Stevens.**

### Statement of Purpose

The primary purpose of this website is to help myself and other developers to **learn**, **build** and **publish*** teachable content to assist in the learning process while adding value and inspiring others to do the same.

### The Learn-Create-Publish Principles

This website was inspired by the ideas of Learn In Public made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank">@swyx</a> and many of the awesome developers and teachers across the world who learn, build, teach, and publish content for others to learn and grow from.
