## About This Website

This is built using Docusaurus 2.0. This site contains the public docs, portfolio, links, and published content for myself, Patrick John Stevens.

Please feel free to utilize the ideas, concepts, principles, and template of this website to inspire and create one for yourself and others.

The main reason I choose to use Docusaurus was that it was simple to get started even for beginners. You'll learn a lot in the process and have some fun too! Docusaurus has wonderful documentation and more and more content is being published every day. I recommend building your site on GitHub and using version control as you build it out. You can deploy for free on Vercel or Netlify. I choose Vercel because it was a little better user experience for most developers.

### Statement of Purpose

The primary purpose of this website is to help myself and other developers to **learn**, **create** and **teach** content to assist in the learning process while adding value and inspiring others to do the same.

### Website Inspiration

This website was inspired by the ideas of Learn In Public made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank">@swyx</a> and many of the awesome developers and teachers across the world who learn, create, teach, and publish content for others to learn and grow from.

Shawn Wang / @swyx has inspired me to create this site. The primary goal with this site is to learn, create and teach in public. He gave me the idea to create a persistent knowledge base that grows over time and simply Open Source my knowledge! My hope is that at every step of the way I will document what I've done and the problems you solved.

This is a living site that will continue to grow and evolve over time. I will continue to add content and improve the site as I learn and grow. I hope you find this site helpful and inspiring as well. I'm here to serve.
