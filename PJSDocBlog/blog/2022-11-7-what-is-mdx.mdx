### What is MDX?

MDX is Markdown + JS (JSX more specifically). You can learn all the details here: [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). It has an article that will show you how to use markdown, JSX, JavaScript expressions, and import and export statements in ESM inside MDX files within Docusaurus. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. ðŸš€

## Markdown Headings (H2)

# H1 Info

This is a Heading 1. This H1 does not rank above the meta title that is auto added to the left and right sidebar in rank 1.

### H3 Info

This is a Heading 3. This H3 creates a title and link in order of the other H1 and H2's on the right sidebar. It also indents it slightly. This helps from a visual and accessibility standpoing.

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

H4, H5, and H6 headings do not show up in the right sidebar but they do follow their associated styling and help with symantic markdown.
